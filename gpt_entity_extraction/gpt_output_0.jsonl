{"instruction": "What are the geological entities from the following text?\n\nPyrite content increases with distance from the MBX and SS stocks, and is most abundant in propylitic altered rocks. Pyrite occurs as disseminations, veinlets, large clots, patches, and as replacements of mafic minerals. Gold mineralization in the 66 Zone is associated with 10 to 20% pyrite, with pyrite also forming a minor constituent in the potassic altered rocks. Cross-cutting relationships indicate several generations of pyrite mineralization.\n", "response": "1. Pyrite\n2. MBX and SS stocks\n3. Propylitic altered rocks\n4. Mafic minerals\n5. Gold mineralization in the 66 Zone\n6. Potassic altered rocks."}

{"instruction": "What are the geological entities from the following text?\n\nThe earliest record of exploration activity in the area is by prospector George Snell, who found gold-bearing float on the western flank of Mt. Milligan in 1937. In 1945, Mr. Snell returned to the area and staked 10 two-post claims west of Mitzi Lake. Five pyritic andesite float samples returned assays ranging from trace to 148.8 g/t of gold. The source of the float was not found and no other gold-bearing mineralization was found in place.\\nThe first recorded claims in the Mt. Milligan region were the Mosquito 1-10 two-post claims staked on August 4, 1972 by Pechiney Development Ltd. (Pechiney). Subsequent exploration work identified induced polarization and soil geochemical anomalies. Pechiney drilled five diamond drill holes to evaluate the anomalies, but identified no significant copper mineralization and Pechiney allowed the claims to lapse.\\nNo further major exploration work in the Mt. Milligan area occurred until 1983 when Selco Inc. (Selco) took an interest in the region. Selco staked the PHIL 1 through 12 claims over the ground covered by the original Mosquito claims, and completed preliminary surveys. In early 1984, Selco amalgamated with BP Resources.", "response": "1. Mt. Milligan\n2. Mitzi Lake\n3. Mosquito 1-10 two-post claims\n4. PHIL 1 through 12 claims\n5. Western flank of Mt. Milligan\n6.
