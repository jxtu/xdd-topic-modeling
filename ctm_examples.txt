As a fundamental organ necessary for the maintenance of life, the immune system first appeared in primitive organisms about 480 million years ago.1 The intricate relationship between acquired immunity and infection was apparent early in recorded history. Observing an epidemic of plague in 430 bc, Thucydides reported that anyone who had recovered from the disease was spared during future outbreaks. The era of modern immunology was launched with Jenner’s report in 1798 of an effective vaccine employing cowpox pustules to prevent smallpox in humans. Improved understanding of immunity and infection continued throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For example, identification of bacterial organisms ultimately resulted in the discovery of antibodies that could neutralize these microbes and/or their toxins, eventually leading to endorsement of the concept of vaccination. The discovery of antibody structure during the 1960s finally began the era of modern immunochemistry. With regard to cellular immunity, despite the early work of Metchnikoff and his followers, the role of cells in acquired immunity was not truly appreciated until the 1950s. Although theories of “self-recognition” and “autoimmunity” appeared early in the twentieth century, autoimmune diseases remain incompletely understood. As a concept, immunogerontology is a relatively recent focus of interest. In 1969, Walford proposed that declining immune function contributes to the biologic processes of aging.2 He speculated that disorders in the immune system that occur with aging account for three major causes of disease in old age: (1) increased autoimmunity; (2) failing surveillance allowing the expression of cancers; and (3) the increased susceptibility to infectious diseases. Current evidence supports the notion that the decline in immune function with aging may be viewed as a form of acquired immunodeficiency of modest dimension. Complicating the assessment of aging on immune function, older people are more likely to have diseases, conditions, or exposures that contribute to declining immune function.3

Previous studies have reported a significant association between nature exposure and positive body image, but understandings of the mechanisms that help to explain this link remain nascent. Here, we considered the extent to which trait mindfulness and connectedness to nature, respectively, mediate the aforementioned relationship both in parallel and serially. An online sample of 398 participants (199 women, 196 men, 3 other; age M = 28.1 years) from the United Kingdom completed measures of self-reported nature exposure, mindful awareness and acceptance, connectedness to nature, and body appreciation. Results indicated that inter-correlations between scores on all measures were significant and positive. Following the elimination of non-significant pathways, path analysis resulted in an adequately-fitting model in which the direct relationship between nature exposure and body appreody appreciation ciation was significant. In addition, connectedness to nature – but not trait mindfulness – significantly mediated the direct relationship. Finally, we also found evidence of a serial mediation, where the association between nature exposure and body appreciation was mediated by mindful awareness followed by connectedness to nature. The implications of these results for scholarly and practitioner understanding of the impact of nature exposure on positive body image are discussed in conclusion.

And for those over 70 or, those who were deemed medically vulnerable, it was recommended that they do not go out for shopping and to plan for food to be delivered to them with a contactless delivery option. Penalties for breaching these restrictions were also being enforced so this was definitely a hard lockdown for everyone in order to stop the community spread of the disease. In response all nine of our physical branch libraries and our two mobile libraries closed. Our staff were transitioned to work from home which was a major undertaking for all staff who were committed to continuing to deliver library services in new ways which often meant improving their technologyrelated skills. However, our message to our members remained that while the physical library may be closed our digital library was still open 24/7. Our library marketing moved to a focus on our eLibrary with lots of guides for how to use it from home. Our library programming went digital and also included links to eResources which meant that many of our members found the digital library easily with an increase in the use of over 600% over the months that the physical library was either closed or open with limited access. At this time, we were also concerned about the serious social isolation and loneliness that our senior members were experiencing during the lockdown. Evidence shows that loneliness leads to social exclusion and increases the risk of a range of illnesses that require hospitalization and long-term care (e.g., depression, dementia). As reported in the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2019) snapshot, most Australians will experience loneliness at some point in their lives (Relationships Australia 2018). According to their data, 1 in 3 Australians reported an episode of loneliness between 2001 and 2009, with 40% of these people experiencing more than 1 episode. Loneliness can be defined as a subjective feeling of not belonging, of lacking companionship. It occurs when our social needs are not being met by our social relationships.

​The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has gravely impacted societies around the world. Outbreaks in different parts of the globe are shaped by repeated introductions of new lineages and subsequent local transmission of those lineages. Here, we sequenced 3940 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Washington State to characterize how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State (USA) was shaped by differences in timing of mitigation strategies across counties, as well as by repeated introductions of viral lineages into the state. Additionally, we show that the increase in frequency of a potentially more transmissible viral variant (614G) over time can potentially be explained by regional mobility differences and multiple introductions of 614G, but not the other variant (614D) into the state. At an individual level, we see evidence of higher viral loads in patients infected with the 614G variant. However, using clinical records .

gene (C9ORF72) was identifi ed as the most common genetic abnormality in familial and sporadic forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the cause in most families where both conditions occur. The associated FTD phenotype is most often the behavioral variant and the motor neuron disease is usually classical ALS; however, a wide range of neurological features are now recognized, including aphasia, memory defi cits, extrapyramidal dysfunction, psychosis and learning disability. The neuropathology of C9ORF72 mutation carriers includes a combination of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 immunoreactive (ir) neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions and neurites (FTLD-TDP) and typical ALS with TDP-43-ir inclusions in motor neurons. The specifi c FTLDTDP subtype is most often type B. Two additional pathological changes are highly characteristic of cases with the C9ORF72 mutation, each of which may play a pathogenic role. Aggregates of RNA, composed of the massively expanded GGGGCC repeat, can be demonstrated in neuronal nuclei using fl uorescent in situ hybridization. These RNA foci are thought to bind and sequester specifi c RNA binding proteins, leading to the abnormal splicing of other genes. Another absolutely sensitive and specifi c pathological change is the presence of neuronal inclusions in the cerebellar granular layer, hippocampal pyramidal neurons and other neuroanatomical sites, that immunostain for markers of the ubiquitin proteasome system (i.e. ubiquitin and p62) but that are negative for TDP-43. It has recently been shown that these inclusions are composed of dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins that result from the unconventional translation of the expanded GGGGCC repeats in both sense and antisense direction and in all reading frames (poly-GA, -GP, -GR and poly-PA, -PG, -PR respectively). Clinicopathological correlative studies have shown that the anatomical distribution of TDP-43 pathology correlates closely with the pattern of neurodegeneration and clinical phenotype. In contrast, the distribution of DPR pathology is highly consistent among cases, with no clinical correlation, suggesting that DPR inclusions may be a useful pathological marker for the presence of the C9ORF72 mutation but are of uncertain pathogenic signifi cance.

Qualitative fit testing for N95 respirators was conducted on 1271 health care workers. All male participants were fitted with a respirator. Six females, all under age 40 years, were not successfully fitted. The first-choice respirator provided a successful fit in 95.1% of the men and 85.4% of the women. Gender and age in women were significant factors associated with successful fitting. These differences should be considered when implementing a respiratory protection program.

Objectives: This study was designed to compare the response and management of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the family physicians of the Hong Kong and the Toronto health systems, and to provide evidence to improve health policy and practices in a newly emerging infectious disease. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to family medicine tutors affiliated with either the Chinese University of Hong Kong or the University of Toronto in 2003. The survey questions covered training for SARS, the use of screening tools, an anxiety scale, clinical practices, and demographic data. Results: 137 (74.8%) and 51 (34%) doctors from Hong Kong and Toronto replied to the questionnaire, respectively. Most (8084.6%) had no training in infectious disease control and were not confident in dealing with SARS (68.1-73.5%). In Hong Kong, the screening tools provided by international agencies did not meet the local needs. In Toronto, lack of a centralized hospital admission policy and fully public laboratory probably resulted in appointment cancellation and dissatisfaction. There may be a need for deployment of personnel between institutions but loss of income was not a major concern. Conclusions: Sharing the ‘‘lessons learned’’ in different regions during a SARS outbreak will help prepare for the next epidemic. (Am J Infect Control 2007;35:50-5.)

Según su composición, las vacunas pueden clasificarse en: vivas, inactivadas y génicas1-14. Las primeras consisten en microorganismos vivos atenuados por diferentes procedimientos2-10. Los agentes inmunizantes se replican en el huésped vacunado al que inmunizan sin causarle la enfermedad natural. Las inactivadas contienen microorganismos enteros inactivados o sus subunidades inmunógenas2-10. Actúan como antígenos inmunógenos no replicantes. En las vacunas génicas no se inyecta el microorganismo o sus fracciones inmunógenas sino el gen que codifica para la proteína inmunizante11-14. En un artículo publicado en el número anterior de esta revista, se han descrito las tecnologías de producción de vacunas vivas atenuadas15. En el presente artículo se describirán los métodos de obtención de las vacunas inactivadas. En el próximo número se abordarán los procedimientos utilizados para la producción de las vacunas génicas. Ellis divide las tecnologías de producción de vacunas inactivadas en clásicas y modernas2,3. Las tecnologías clásicas incluyen los procedimientos utilizados hasta muy recientemente para la obtención de las vacunas inactivadas enteras o de sus fracciones o subunidades inmunógenas naturales (inactivación por procedimientos físicos o químicos). Los nuevos métodos de producción de vacunas inactivadas utilizan la tecnología de ADN recombinante para la obtención de proteínas inmunizantes, expresan proteínas inmunizantes en plantas a las que se ha introducido el gen que las codifica, conjugan polisacáridos capsulares con proteínas para convertirlos en T-dependientes o producen péptidos inmunizantes por síntesis química (tabla 1). Hay dos tipos de vacunas inactivadas, las de microorganismos enteros (vacunas de bacterias o virus enteros inactivados) y las de subunidades (fracciones antigénicas inmunizantes de bacterias o virus). A diferencia de las vacunas vivas atenuadas, en estas vacunas no es posible la reversión a la patogenicidad, lo que constituye una importante ventaja2,3. Como contrapartida, al no replicarse el agente infectante en el huésped, se requiere mayor masa antigénica e inyecciones repetidas (booster) para conseguir niveles inmunitarios protectores de larga duración.2,3,16 No obstante, en algunos casos (vacunas antihepatitis B y A) se ha conseguido una buena protección a medio plazo con la primovacunación, sin necesidad de revacunaciones2. Otra importante diferencia es que estas vacunas, por lo general, sólo dan lugar a una respuesta inmunitaria humoral (linfocitos B y anticuerpos), a diferencia de las vacunas vivas atenuadas que desencadenan, además, una respuesta inmunitaria celular de linfocitos Tc2,3,16.
